# Pub finder general client 

As the Repo says much nicer than the witch finder and the only place to go for the best after work tipple. 

## Not fully operational
Currently pub finder general is under construction so the only working page so far is the list of Pubs. 

The show more buttons are not functional and there is no ability to sort or filter yet.

## Code completeness
In much the same way the pact tests are present for pub finder general client but they are not yet fully functional. 
Aware of the time i was taking i felt it better to get it back with as many fetures as possible and leave the nice to haves till later. 

Currently this shows, multiple components, services and hooks. 

Also note that in the AUth Service no token is set up or required as the API isn't currently set up to check the token. I felt this would be going to far and was 
primarily setting up a service just for auth that ultimately would take time away from the functionality to set up something that is standard and already set up in most places.
